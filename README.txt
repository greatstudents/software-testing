Coverage.py are tools for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It monitors the program, noting which parts of the code have been executed; it then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not. Unit test discovery and execution frameworks are used to add tests to existing code, execute those tests, and compile a simple report, without ‘thinking’.

Nose test is a tool for running unit tests, and has a useful plug-in architecture that enables users to extend it in convenient ways; it can be adapted to mimic any unit test discovery framework simply.
